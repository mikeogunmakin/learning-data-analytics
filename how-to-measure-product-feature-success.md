 # How do you measure the success of a Product Feature?

# 📘 What I Learned About Measuring Product Feature Success – Actionable Insights

1. 🧭 **Differentiate Product Metrics vs Business Metrics**  
   - Use business model frameworks like **AARRR** for high-level company metrics.  
   - Use product-focused frameworks like **HEART** for feature-level assessment—but even HEART can be too high-level on its own.

2. 🔍 **Use Behavioural Analysis, Not Just Volume Metrics**  
   - Go beyond tracking feature usage counts. Understand **who** is using the feature, **how often**, and **in what context**.

3. 🧠 **Apply Amplitude’s 7-Step Analysis Method**  
   - 📈 Measure basic usage of the feature
        - total number of times people are using the feature
        - the number of unique users who are using the feature 
        - the percentage of your total active users who are using the feature
        - the average number of times per day users are using the feature
   - 🧬 Explore event properties for usage patterns 
        - what segment/type of users are using the feature? (user segments)
        - Which part/element of the feature is most and least popular?
        - Interesting trends on usage?
   - 🔁 Analyse what users do **before** and **after** using the feature 
        - event flow leading up to product feature usage?
        - event flow after product usage?
        - what % of users perform a particular action before/after usage?
   - 👥 Build a cohort of users who used the feature  
        - impact on retention - users that use the feature vs does that do not?
        - do new users who use the feature (in first day/month) retain better than new users who do not?
   - 📊 Analyse how the feature impacts **retention**  
        - do new users who use the feature (in first day/month) retain better than new users who do not?
   - 💡 Check the feature's effect on **conversion funnels**  
        - how does the conversion funnel for users vs non-users compare?
   - 🔄 Evaluate how it affects **engagement**
        - how does engagement differ from those that use the feature vs does that have not?

4. ⚠️ **Don’t Confuse Correlation with Causation**  
   - Usage patterns don’t imply that the feature caused the change—further experimentation or A/B testing is needed to prove impact.

5. 🧰 **Use a Practical Feature Success Framework (Paul’s Own)**  
   Ask the following questions for any product feature:
   - 🌍 **Popularity** – How many active users interact with this feature weekly/daily?  
   - 🔁 **Habit** – How regularly is it used per week?  
   - ⏱️ **Usage Frequency** – How often is it used per day?  
   - 📈 **Retention Impact** – Does it improve user retention?  
   - 💰 **Monetisation** – How does usage differ between free and paid users?  
   - 🧭 **Context** – What actions do users take before and after using the feature?  
   - ✅ **Simplicity** – What’s the feature’s completion rate?
