# Customer Churn 

Churn, also known as attrition, it is the loss of customers or users over a given period. It's commonly used in business, especially subscription-based or service industries, to measure customer rentention and loyalty.

Churn rate is the metric used to measure churn, it is the percentage of lost (churned) users over a given period. It is calculated as follows:

**Churn Rate** = \(\frac{\text{Customers lost during a period}}{\text{Total customers at the start of the period}} \times 100\)

🔁 **Cohort Analysis is Essential**  
   - Analysing churn using customer cohorts (grouped by acquisition month) reveals how retention decays over time.  
   - It helps identify how long customers stay and when churn spikes.

📉 **Churn Rate Has a Compounding Effect**  
   - Even small monthly churn rates compound significantly over time, dramatically shrinking the long-term customer base.  
   - Example: Reducing churn from 10% to 1.9% led Netflix to grow its customer base by **+169%** over 3 years.

🧮 **Churn Limits Growth Potential**  
   - There’s a **maximum customer base** a company can reach given its acquisition and churn rates.  
   - Formula:  `Max Customer Base = Monthly Acquisition / Monthly Churn Rate`

🚀 **Reducing Churn Unlocks Growth**  
   - Lower churn means each new customer adds more long-term value.  
   - Investing in churn reduction (e.g., through better onboarding, engagement, or support) is a powerful and sustainable growth lever.

📊 **Benchmarking Against Ideal Scenarios Helps Quantify Loss**  
   - Comparing actual growth with a 0% churn “ideal case” highlights how much growth is lost due to churn.  
   - This visualises the ROI of churn reduction efforts.

⚠️ **Churn is a Silent Killer**  
   - High churn isn’t always obvious, especially with strong acquisition. But it erodes long-term growth quietly.  
   - Sustainable businesses obsess over retention, not just acquisition.
